    <h3> About Elena </h3>
    <p> After gradutating high school I decided to go to school for ASL, and am fluent. I have moved around the country a few times, but as a child I would go back to Spain to see my family, and would love to be able to raise my family back in Europe. </p>
    <p> I started my journey at Thinkful because a few of my freinds are developers and engineers and saw a lot of potential in me and I truly do owe them the world for opening this new found love.</p>
